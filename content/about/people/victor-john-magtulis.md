Victor Magtulis is an early-career researcher in air quality science and management. He is currently a faculty member of the Chemical Engineering Department at Central Philippine University. His interests include atmospheric chemistry, air quality monitoring, and public policy. As an advocate for clean air initiatives and sustainable development, he currently leads a local community project using low-cost air quality sensors to monitor air pollution levels and variation in Iloilo City, Philippines.

Prior to his post at Central Philippine University, he worked as an air quality technician and environmental impact assessment (EIA) consultant at Geosphere Technologies, Inc., an Engineering and Environmental Consulting Firm based in the Philippines.  As a registered EIA specialist, Victor has worked in diverse Environmental Management and EIA-related projects for both private and government funded infrastructure development projects in the country. A chemical engineer by profession, the experience inspired him to return to academia to explore air quality science and management as a field of interest. Victor is currently pursuing a postgraduate degree in Environmental Assessment at the University of Kansas.
