Thanasak Thumbuntu is a determined novice advocate fighting for clean air in Thailand. With a background as a dentist and a master's degree in health policy from the University of Edinburgh, UK, he brings a unique perspective to the battle against air pollution. For nine years, Thanasak dedicated himself to ensuring universal access to oral health services, fundraising, building dental clinics, and implementing accreditation programs. However, his personal experience of suffering health impacts from air pollution drove him to explore the intricate relationship between health and the environment. This led him to join the organizing team of a global health conference on the health-environment nexus. He initiated the policy forum, "Moving Towards the Right to Clean Air in Thailand," where experts collaboratively devised strategies to combat the PM2.5 crisis. Besides his academic and collaborative skills, Thanasak excels in visual note-taking and social media communication. These abilities empower him to drive change by utilizing health as a compelling argument to tackle air pollution and mobilize the health sector. With his diverse background and unwavering passion for public health and environmental justice, he stands as a key advocate in the movement towards a healthier and cleaner future.
