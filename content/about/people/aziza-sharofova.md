Aziza Sharofova is an environmental engineer with many years of experience in the environmental field. Having started in the private sector developing EIA projects, she devoted more than seven years to state ecological expertise, assessing the impact of industrial facilities on nature.

Since July 2024, she has been with the Ministry of Ecology and now works in the Department of Atmospheric Air Protection. Her goal is to implement effective solutions to improve air quality and develop sustainable environmental policies.

Ecology is a challenge that requires an integrated approach. Therefore, as of this year, she also has started studying for a Master's degree in Project Management. Aziza believes that "Environmentalism is not just a job, but a responsibility for the future!"
