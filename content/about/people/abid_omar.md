Abid Omar has a social mission: *how can I help improve the environment of Pakistan*? He sees the air pollution emergency in Pakistan as a silver lining â€” an opportunity to drive environmental awareness and change that will clean up Pakistan for good. A key indicator of environmental issues is pollution that affects our daily lives, particularly air pollution. He found that there was no air quality data, so he founded the Pakistan Air Quality Initiative in 2016 to monitor air quality across major urban areas of Pakistan. Abid advocates for reducing air pollution by providing open access to air quality data, through workshops and conferences, and hopes to publish his data and findings in a scientific journal.
