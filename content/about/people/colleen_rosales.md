Colleen joined OpenAQ August 2022. At OpenAQ, Colleen builds strategic relationships with air quality stakeholders worldwide—introducing people to the OpenAQ platform, spurring data-informed projects that advance clean air objectives, and supporting partnerships across sectors and geographies.

Colleen has a Ph.D. in Environmental Science from Indiana University and has over ten years of experience in indoor and outdoor air pollution. Besides her scientific work, which includes publications in Science Advances and Nature Communications, Colleen is skilled in data analysis and programming, project management, digital communications and technical writing, and relationship building. Colleen uses dual technical and leadership skills to serve as a fulcrum point for the growth of OpenAQ.

Colleen is also currently doing postdoctoral research with the Air Quality Research Center at the University of California in Davis, where she programs high-throughput comparative analyses of instrumentation for air monitoring. At Indiana University Bloomington, she taught and managed collaborative indoor and outdoor projects involving research groups from various universities from 2016 through 2021. Prior to that, Colleen worked with the Aerosol Technology Monitoring Lab at the Gwangju Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea, the Institute of Environmental Science & Meteorology and Institute of Chemistry at the University of the Philippines (where she finished her undergraduate degree in Chemistry), Clean Air Asia, and the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute.

In her spare time, Colleen fundraises for her undergraduate school in the Philippines and promotes climate policy with her local Citizens’ Climate Lobby chapter in Indiana. She is also a member of the American Geophysical Union, American Association for Aerosol Research, and American Meteorological Society.
