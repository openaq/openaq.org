# Raising awareness for the community

A community-based organization (CBO) called "Clean Air for All" is using OpenAQ's API to access real-time air quality data for their city. The organization's goal is to improve air quality in their community by educating residents about the sources of air pollution and encouraging them to take action to reduce it.

Clean Air for All is using the OpenAQ API to access data on air pollutant levels in their city, including levels of particulate matter, nitrogen dioxide, and ozone. The organization is using this data to create maps and visualizations that show the concentration of these pollutants in different parts of the city. This information is then shared with community members through the organization's website and social media channels, along with tips and advice on how to reduce exposure to air pollution.

# Playing it by the numbers

The organization is also using the OpenAQ API to track changes in air quality over time, and to identify areas of the city where air pollution levels are particularly high. This information is used to target outreach and education efforts, as well as to advocate for policies and programs that can improve air quality in those areas.

Clean Air for All is seeing positive results from their use of the OpenAQ API. The organization's outreach efforts are increasing awareness of air pollution and its impact on health, and community members are taking action to reduce their own contributions to air pollution. As a result, air quality in the city is improving, and the organization is playing a key role in this positive change.
