# Why air quality

By promoting transparency and accountability, openaq.org helps individuals and communities make informed decisions about their health and the health of their environment.

### Poor Air Quality has a significant impact on health

In addition to its impacts on human health, poor air quality can also harm the environment. Polluted air can damage plants and animals, and can even harm entire ecosystems. This can have significant economic consequences, as it can reduce crop yields and harm agricultural productivity. Additionally, poor air quality can impact tourism and other industries that depend on clean air and natural beauty.  

## Inequality increases with worsening air quality

In conclusion, air quality is a critical issue that deserves our attention and action. By working together, we can ensure that the air we breathe is clean and healthy, and that we are protecting the environment for future generations.
