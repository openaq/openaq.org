Air quality data is factual in nature, and in some jurisdictions may not be subject to copyright or other protections limiting its use or distribution. However, in some jurisdictions, copyright and/or laws and regulations may apply to some of the data on the OpenAQ platform.

A number of our sources provide their air quality data under specific licensing, such as Creative Commons licensing or open government licenses, which require source attribution. Regardless of such requirements, we believe in the importance of attributing data sources and strongly encourage everyone to do so. Read our [Data Policy](https://github.com/openaq/openaq-info/blob/master/DATA-POLICY.md) for more information.
