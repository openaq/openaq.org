The OpenAQ governing board and team developed core strategic objectives to guide the organization as shown in our [OpenAQ 2022-2025 strategic direction](https://documents.openaq.org/strategy/OpenAQ+Strategic+Direction-Abbreviated.pdf)

Three core objectives drive the technical direction of the OpenAQ platform:

1. Make air quality data universally accessible and equip stakeholders with tools to use it  

2. Maintain and strategically increase the amount and types of data on our platform  

3. Spur greater use of air quality data by introducing potential users to the platform and how it can be used

## Roadmap for 2025

### 1 Tools

* Release an official R package for the OpenAQ API.  

* Release new features for common use-cases into OpenAQ Python SDK.  

* Release new features for common use-cases into OpenAQ CLI.

### 2 Data coverage

* Develop and release an upload tool to more easily allow contributions from small projects.  

* Acquire new and regain lost government-produced data, prioritizing:  

  * India  
  * Brazil  
  * South Africa  
  * TÃ¼rkiye

* Fill in historical gaps across geographies, where possible.

### 3 Outreach and Documentation

* Improve documentation sites (API documentations site, Python documentation, R documentation and CLI documentation) with more examples of how to use the platform for common use cases.

This roadmap was largely informed by the OpenAQ community through outreach and the results of our [Community Survey](https://openaq.medium.com/the-2024-openaq-community-survey-results-71d0d8f42ff7).
