For the best support and to connect with others who might have encountered similar challenges, we highly encourage you to join our [Slack](https://join.slack.com/t/openaq/shared_invite/zt-3bv5rrhnp-rgrQbf6CavRSihhTW_swmA) community or submit issues on our GitHub page at [https://github.com/openaq](https://github.com/openaq) in the relevant repository. Slack is a fantastic place to engage in real-time discussions with our team and fellow users, allowing for quick exchanges of ideas, troubleshooting tips, and shared experiences. It’s more than just a support channel—it’s a space where you can be part of an active, collaborative community that’s eager to help each other out.

On the other hand, GitHub is perfect for more detailed issue tracking and problem-solving. By submitting issues or browsing through existing ones, you can see how others have tackled similar problems and contribute your own solutions. GitHub's structured format makes it easy to document and follow up on bugs, feature requests, and ongoing discussions, ensuring that valuable insights aren’t lost.

Both Slack and GitHub are designed to foster community interaction and shared learning. Whether you're asking questions, offering advice, or just exploring what others have done, these platforms are powerful tools for building knowledge together and helping each other succeed. We believe that by participating in these communities, you’ll not only get the support you need but also contribute to a collective learning environment where everyone benefits.
