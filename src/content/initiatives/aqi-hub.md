OpenAQ’s [AQI Hub](https://aqihub.info) is a comprehensive and user-friendly resource for understanding Air Quality Indexes (AQIs). An AQI translates complex pollutant concentration data into a simple, understandable format so that people can assess their exposure to air pollution and take action to safeguard their health and well-being. However AQIs are not standard–they differ significantly across the globe. Based on similar pollution levels, one country’s AQI may signal that the air is acceptable to breathe, while another country’s AQI might indicate caution. The AQI Hub “demystifies” AQIs, explaining what an air quality index is and detailing the methodologies different countries use to build their AQIs. On the AQI Hub, one can explore a single AQI or compare and contrast AQIs.
