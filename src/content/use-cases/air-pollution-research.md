Access to key open data sets (emission sources, air pollution levels, meteorological/atmospheric conditions, etc.) are fundamental to air pollution research. OpenAQ serves as one of these important data sets, used by many scientific researchers to, for example, evaluate and verify air pollution models. 



## **The Problem**

As just one example of the numerous health implications of air pollution, in heavily polluted regions like India’s cities, even young, non-smoking patients suffer from lung damage due to chronic exposure. Despite the severity of the issue, understanding and addressing air pollution remains difficult without access to reliable, timely, and comprehensive air quality data that has been harmonized for easy, immediate use.



## **The Solution**

Air quality researchers are working to uncover the causes and impacts of pollution through data-driven studies that inform health-based interventions and long-term policy changes . From analyzing pollution reductions during COVID-19 lockdowns to identifying biomass burning as a primary seasonal driver in India, these scientists use modeling and real-world data to pinpoint pollution sources and recommend targeted, practical solutions. Prerita Agarwal investigated seasonal air pollution in India and found that biomass burning—not just traffic or industrial emissions—was a major contributor during certain months. Caterina Mogno utilized satellite and sensor data to investigate the effects of pollution on lung health, including in young individuals. Together, these studies demonstrate that when researchers have access to clean, comparable, and timely data, they can identify key pollution sources and trends and provide governments with evidence to support more effective and targeted policies.



## **How OpenAQ Helps**

OpenAQ plays a critical role in enabling this and countless other research applications by providing free, open, and machine-readable access to surface-level air quality data. Researchers Zander Venter, Prerita Agarwal, and Caterina Mogno all relied on OpenAQ to validate their models, reduce time spent on data management, and ensure their work included data from underserved regions, such as the Global South. The platform’s global scope, historical archives, and ease of access make meaningful research possible, speeding up insights and supporting real-world impact.
