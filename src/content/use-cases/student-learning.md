For many university students, accessing and working with data from OpenAQ serves as a real-world, hands-on learning experience that increases their data fluency and deepens their understanding of the air pollution crisis.

**The Problem**
Students studying environmental health, urban planning, and other fields using applied data science need access to such datasets as comprehensive, real-time air quality data. Without hands-on experience, it is challenging for students to fully understand the impacts of air pollution or learn how to analyze and address these challenges in their future careers.

**The Solution**
OpenAQ provides the largest open-source, open-access global air quality dataset, enabling hands-on, interactive learning experiences for students across disciplines. Through accessible, real-world data, students can analyze local and international air pollution trends, understand sources, and explore equitable solutions in their communities.

**How OpenAQ Helps**
Educators at institutions such as Johns Hopkins University, the University of Colorado Denver, and Monash University incorporate OpenAQ into their coursework and labs, enabling students to engage directly with air quality data. This fosters critical thinking, data literacy, and an appreciation for the importance of accessible, standardized environmental data. Students investigate real-world cases, such as pollution spikes during festivals or industrial accidents, gaining insights that prepare them to influence future urban planning and environmental health policies. “Using OpenAQ’s website with comprehensive global air quality data down to their hometown is extremely exciting for my students,” says Dr. Priyanka deSouza from CU-Denver. “We get some great individual learnings from the OpenAQ-based lab,” adds Dr. Pete DeCarlo from Johns Hopkins.
