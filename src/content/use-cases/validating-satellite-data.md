Satellites orbiting Earth are able to fill air quality data gaps in regions with little or no ground-level monitoring by applying mathematical models to the atmospheric data that they collect. However, satellite-based observations have limitations and challenges. Ground measurements are needed to calibrate and improve the accuracy of satellite predictions and forecasts. Because OpenAQ provides open access to global ground-level air quality data, we play a critical role in improving satellite estimates of air quality.



## **The Problem**

Many of the most polluted regions of the world lack reliable air quality data because they do not have the resources to conduct comprehensive and ongoing monitoring. Without l these data, scientists struggle to accurately identify pollution sources and health impacts; governments cannot effectively warn the public; and policymakers are unable to take informed action.



## **The Solution**

Researchers are bridging information gaps by combining global satellite measurements with more precise measurements from ground-level air quality monitors. Innovative projects, such as NOAA/NSF NCAR’s MELODIES MONET toolkit and machine-learning models developed by the Finnish Meteorological Institute, enhance the integration and accuracy of air pollution data. These advancements provide actionable air quality data on a global scale.



## **How OpenAQ Helps**

OpenAQ provides a foundational dataset essential for these efforts. 

“OpenAQ was crucial. The project would not have been possible without it as it would have taken too long to gather all the data,” remarks Antti Lipponen, a researcher from the Finnish Meteorological Institute. Researchers also highlight OpenAQ’s extensive set of sources, openness, and global coverage as key strengths. “OpenAQ brings in so many observations all the way from reference-grade to low-cost sensors. More data means better models and better science,” says Jordan Schnell, a researcher involved in MELODIES MONET.

OpenAQ’s fully publicly accessible trove of global air quality accelerates scientific discovery, improves pollution forecasts, and helps protect vulnerable populations by enabling accurate, real-time air quality assessments across the world.
