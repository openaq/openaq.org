Colleen joined OpenAQ in August 2022 and is a driving force in building strategic relationships with air quality partners worldwide. As the coordinator of the [OpenAQ Clean Air Community Ambassador program](https://ambassadors.openaq.org/), she introduces individuals to the OpenAQ platform, catalyzes data-informed projects for clean air, and fosters cross-sector and cross-geographic partnerships.

With a Ph.D. in Environmental Science from Indiana University and over a decade of experience in scientific air pollution research, Colleen brings a unique blend of technical expertise and leadership. She excels in data analysis, programming, project management, digital communications, technical writing, and relationship building, leveraging these skills to drive OpenAQ's growth.

Colleen also conducts postdoctoral research at the University of California, Davis's Air Quality Research Center, focusing on high-throughput comparative analyses of air monitoring instrumentation. Her prior experience includes managing collaborative projects at Indiana University Bloomington and working in institutions such as the Gwangju Institute of Technology, South Korea; the University of the Philippines Institute of Chemistry and Institute of Environmental Science and Meteorology; Clean Air Asia; and the Philippine Nuclear Research Institute.

In her spare time, Colleen actively fundraises for her undergraduate alma mater in the Philippines and advocates for climate policy locally in her city. She serves on the board of her state's Air and Waste Management Association (A&WMA) chapter and is a member of the Editorial Advisory Committee for EM, A&WMA's magazine for environmental managers.
