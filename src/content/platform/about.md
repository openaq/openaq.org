OpenAQ is the worldâ€™s largest open-source, open-access platform for ground-level
ambient air quality data. To gather and harmonize the world's air quality data,
OpenAQ searches and scrapes hundreds of data sources to extract and store data.
OpenAQ gathers physical measurements, not aggregated values such as AQIs (Air
Quality Indexes).

# Open Source
