title: "What types of data does OpenAQ ingest?"
---

OpenAQ ingests ambient air quality data measurements from ground-level stations. Data must be ‘raw’ and reported in physical concentrations on their originating site. Data cannot be shared in an 'Air Quality Index' or equivalent format. Data must be at the ‘station-level,’ associable with geographic coordinates, not aggregated into a higher (e.g., city) level. Data should be from measurements averaged between 10 minutes and 24 hours.
