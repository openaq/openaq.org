title: "What is the license for data on OpenAQ?"

Air quality data is factual in nature, and in some jurisdictions may not be subject to copyright or other protections limiting its use or distribution. However, in some jurisdictions, copyright and/or laws and regulations may apply to some of the data on the OpenAQ platform.

A number of our sources provide their air quality data under specific licensing, such as Creative Commons licensing or open government licenses, which require source attribution. Regardless of whether such requirements exist or not, we provide attribution to the underlying source of data ingested onto the OpenAQ Platform.

When required, OpenAQ users must acknowledge the original source(s) of any data they use, following the providerâ€™s terms, and OpenAQ encourages users to acknowledge all original sources, even if the provider does not require it.

Read our [Data Policy](https://github.com/openaq/openaq-info/blob/master/DATA-POLICY.md) for more information.
